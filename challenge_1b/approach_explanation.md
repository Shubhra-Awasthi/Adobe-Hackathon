# Intelligent Document Analyst - Approach Explanation

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a sophisticated multi-stage AI pipeline that intelligently analyzes document collections to extract the most relevant sections based on persona and job-to-be-done requirements. The system uses a hybrid approach combining fast similarity search with precise reranking to achieve both speed and accuracy.

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Smart Document Processing
The system begins with intelligent PDF parsing using PyMuPDF, extracting both text content and font metadata. This enables automatic heading detection through font-size heuristics, allowing the system to preserve document structure and create meaningful chunks that maintain context.

### 2. Dual-Model AI Pipeline
We employ a two-stage AI approach for optimal performance:
- **Bi-Encoder Stage**: Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (~80MB) for fast similarity search across all document chunks
- **Cross-Encoder Stage**: Uses `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` (~100MB) for precise relevance scoring of candidate chunks

### 3. Efficient Vector Search
FAISS indexing with L2 distance enables sub-second similarity search across thousands of chunks. The system retrieves top candidates (configurable, default 20) before applying the more computationally intensive cross-encoder reranking.

### 4. Context-Aware Query Generation
The system dynamically constructs queries by combining persona information with job requirements, ensuring the AI models understand both who is asking (persona) and what they need to accomplish (job-to-be-done).

### 5. Granular Sentence Extraction
For each top-ranked chunk, the system performs sentence-level analysis using the cross-encoder to identify the most relevant sentences, providing both section-level and sentence-level relevance.

## Performance Optimizations

- **CPU-Only Processing**: All models optimized for CPU inference
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch sizes for memory efficiency
- **Model Caching**: Pre-downloaded models eliminate internet dependency
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable chunk sizes, candidate counts, and output limits

## Key Innovations

1. **Font-Based Heading Detection**: Automatically identifies document sections without manual annotation
2. **Hybrid Relevance Scoring**: Combines fast retrieval with precise reranking
3. **Persona-Aware Processing**: Incorporates user context into relevance calculations
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Handles 3-10 documents with consistent performance

The system achieves sub-60-second processing times while maintaining high relevance scores through intelligent chunking, efficient vector search, and context-aware AI processing.
